## Approach

I approached this project in a structured way as there was a time limit and the assignment expected functionality and Aesthetics. I started by first planning the structure, then building core functionality, and finally focusing on polish and usability. My goal was to keep the user experience simple and smooth, while also writing clean, maintainable code.
